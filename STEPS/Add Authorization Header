1. Add Authorization Header
Before making any request, you need to add the Authorization Header for your API to verify that the request is valid. This will be required for all requests (Books and Members).
Steps to Set Authorization in Postman:
      Open Postman.
      Select the Headers tab.
      Add the following key-value pair to the Headers section:
        Key: Authorization
        Value: Bearer library123
